title: RO-Crate Overview
description: Understand how OSCAR Hub relies on RO-Crate to describe every service.
---

RO-Crate is a lightweight way to package research objects with machine-readable metadata. In OSCAR Hub we treat each service as a dataset whose metadata lives in `ro-crate-metadata.json`. The build script parses this file and renders the landing page content from it.

## Key concepts we rely on

### `@graph`
A list of all entities related to your service (dataset, software dependencies, authors, icons). Every node has an `@id` used for cross-references.

### Dataset node (`@id: "./"`)
This is the entry point for the catalog. The fields displayed on the landing page (name, description, service type, hardware/software requirements) all live here.

### Linked entities
Objects such as the license, authors, or software requirements can be defined once and referenced via `@id`. The catalog flattens them for display while preserving their structure internally.

### Assets and icons
Logos are referenced via the dataset `logo` property and stored next to the crate. The build process copies them into `dist/assets/icons/<slug>/` so the catalog can render service cards.

### Starter template
The repository ships with a ready-to-edit blueprint under [`template/`](../../../../template). It includes a fully linked RO-Crate (`ro-crate-metadata.json`), placeholder assets (`fdl.yml`, `script.sh`, `icon.png`, `sample-input.txt`), and acceptance test nodes. Copy it to bootstrap new services and then trim the sections you do not need.

## Minimal example

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": { "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1" },
      "about": { "@id": "./" }
    },
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "name": "YOLOv8 Object Detection",
      "description": "Perform GPU-accelerated YOLOv8 inference inside OSCAR.",
      "serviceType": "synchronous",
      "URL": "https://github.com/grycap/oscar-hub/tree/main/crates/yolov8",
      "author": { "@id": "#grycap" },
      "license": { "@id": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" },
      "datePublished": "2024-05-16",
      "memoryRequirements": "8 GiB",
      "softwareRequirements": [ { "@id": "#yolov8" } ],
      "logo": { "@id": "icon.png" }
    },
    { "@id": "#grycap", "@type": "Organization", "name": "GRyCAP" },
    { "@id": "#yolov8", "@type": "SoftwareApplication", "name": "Ultralytics YOLOv8" },
    {
      "@id": "icon.png",
      "@type": [ "File", "ImageObject" ],
      "name": "Service icon",
      "encodingFormat": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```
> ℹ️ When you reference local files (like `icon.png`) in `logo` or `hasPart`, make sure the actual file is bundled alongside `ro-crate-metadata.json`. Validators will flag missing resources.

Use this page as the conceptual overview, then continue to the dedicated sections for detailed field requirements and validation tips.
