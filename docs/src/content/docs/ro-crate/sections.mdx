description: Detailed description of each section in an OSCAR Hub RO-Crate file.

## Dataset node (`./`)

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | Appears as the card title. Keep it short and action-oriented. |
| `description` | ✅ | Full markdown-free text. The first 240 characters are shown on the card, the rest lives in the detail modal/JSON. |
| `serviceType` | ✅ | `synchronous` or `asynchronous`. Values outside this set will hide filter options. |
| `URL` | ✅ | Destination for users (repository, API explorer, documentation). |
| `license` | ✅ | Either a single `@id` to a remote resource or an inline object with `name` + `url`. |
| `author` | ✅ | Person or organisation. Provide `name` and `url` for attribution. |
| `datePublished` | ✅ | ISO-8601 date. Update whenever you make a significant change. |
| `memoryRequirements` | ⚙️ | Free-form string describing CPU/GPU requirements. |
| `processorRequirements` | ⚙️ | Array of CPU/GPU strings when multiple SKUs are supported. |
| `softwareRequirements` | ⚙️ | Array of references (objects or `@id`s) pointing to nodes that describe dependencies. |
| `logo` | ⚙️ | Reference to `icon.png` (or similar). Must exist on disk. |

## License node
Define once inside `@graph` when you need extra fields:

```json
{
  "@id": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "MIT License"
}
```

## Author node
You can describe a person or organisation. Both can include contact URLs.

```json
{
  "@id": "#maintainer",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "GRyCAP",
  "url": "https://www.grycap.upv.es"
}
```

## Software requirements

Represent each dependency with its own node:

```json
{
  "@id": "#torch",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "PyTorch",
  "version": "2.1",
  "url": "https://pytorch.org"
}
```

Mention the node inside the dataset `softwareRequirements` array:

```json
"softwareRequirements": [{ "@id": "#torch" }, { "@id": "#ultralytics" }]
```

## Icon assets

- Store the PNG alongside the metadata file.
- Reference it via `logo: { "@id": "icon.png" }`.
- Optional dark/light variants can use different filenames, but make sure they exist or the parser logs a warning.

Later sections walk through validation commands and checklists so your crate is accepted on the first review.
