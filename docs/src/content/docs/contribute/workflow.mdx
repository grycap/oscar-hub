## Branching strategy

- Base all work on `main`. Use short-lived feature branches such as `feature/yolov8-docs`.
- Keep each branch focused on a single concern (new crate, metadata update, documentation addition).
- Rebase or merge from `main` frequently to avoid conflicts in shared assets like `dist/` output or shared styles.

## Issue tracking

1. Open an issue describing the proposed service or improvement. Include acceptance criteria and a link to upstream assets or research outputs.
2. Reference the issue number in your branch name and pull request description.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds locally (generates catalog + documentation bundle).
- [ ] Screenshots or GIFs show new UI affordances when relevant.
- [ ] Every crate includes a valid `ro-crate-metadata.json`, icon asset, and optional README if it needs extra operational notes.
- [ ] Documentation is updated whenever new concepts or metadata fields are introduced.

## Code review expectations

- **Small diff sets:** Aim for ≤400 lines per PR. Split metadata uploads and docs updates if needed.
- **Actionable feedback:** Ask for clarification using threaded comments. Suggest edits through GitHub suggestions when the fix is trivial.
- **Approvals:** At least one maintainer review is required. Metadata changes that affect compliance (e.g., new mandatory fields) require two approvals.

## Deployment pipeline

1. GitHub Actions will run `npm run build` and publish the artifacts to the `dist/` folder.
2. The static assets (catalog) deploy to the `hub.oscar.grycap.net` site root.
3. The documentation bundle generated from `docs/dist` is copied under `/guide`, giving every release an up-to-date guide.

## Post-merge duties

- Monitor the deployment status for failures.
- Open follow-up issues for known gaps or TODOs that did not block the merge.
- Announce new services or documentation updates in the OSCAR communication channels (mailing list, Slack, etc.).
