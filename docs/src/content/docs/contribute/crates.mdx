title: Adding & Maintaining Crates
description: Step-by-step checklist for adding a new service crate or updating an existing one.
---

## Create a new crate

1. Duplicate the `template/` directory and rename it to your slug (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens).
2. Update the copied `ro-crate-metadata.json` with your service-specific data. Keep only the fields you intend to populate.
3. Keep the files referenced in `hasPart` (`fdl.yml`, `script.sh`, `icon.png`, optional `sample-input.txt`) in sync with reality—either provide the files or remove the references.
4. Include any deployment notes (`README.md`, sample payloads) that users might need to exercise the service.

## Required metadata

The `./` dataset node must include:

- `name`: Human-friendly service name.
- `description`: Two or three sentences describing what the service does and how OSCAR users benefit.
- `serviceType`: `synchronous` or `asynchronous`.
- `license`: Link or inline object describing the license.
- `author`: Person or organization responsible for the service.
- `URL`: Target application endpoint, repository, or landing page.
- `datePublished`: `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

Include optional-but-valuable fields when available: `memoryRequirements`, `processorRequirements`, `softwareRequirements`, `keywords`, and `version`.

## Testing metadata

Run the build locally to ensure the crate is parsed correctly:

```bash
npm run build && rocrate-validator validate -p ro-crate-1.1 --no-paging ./crates/<service>
```

- The build will warn if an icon is missing or if the dataset node cannot be found.
- [`rocrate-validator`](https://pypi.org/project/rocrate-validator/) (Python) or any JSON-LD validator confirms structural correctness whenever you tweak schema-heavy sections.

## Keeping crates up to date

- **Version updates:** Increment `datePublished`, and describe the change in the pull request.
- **Deprecations:** Mention alternatives in the dataset `description` and note the status in the pull request if a service is being retired.
- **Icon refresh:** Replace the PNG and ensure the aspect ratio stays square so cards render uniformly.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Crate missing from the catalog | Check for JSON syntax errors or missing `./` dataset node. Run `npm run dev` and inspect the console warnings. |
| Icon placeholder shows initials | Confirm the dataset `logo` reference points to `icon.png` and that the file exists. |
| Filters misbehave | Ensure `serviceType` uses lowercase values that match the `<select>` options in `src/build.mjs`. |

Once your crate passes these checks, open a pull request referencing the relevant issue.
