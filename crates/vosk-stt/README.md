# Vosk STT Service for OSCAR 

[Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) is a fully offline, open-source speech-to-text (STT) toolkit. Its architecture is notable for its efficiency, using lightweight models that enable near-instantaneous responses even on modest hardware, and for its exceptional robustness, capable of accurately processing background noise and technical terms. It also offers versatile multi-language support.

The Vosk STT service processes an audio file and returns the result as a text file. It is currently built on [models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) to process English and Spanish audio. It cannot recognize the speaker's language, so the input file must have the following structure: **audio.wav** for Spanish audio and **audio_en.wav** for English audio. It supports any input audio file format. The output format is a .txt file containing the text generated by the speech recognition process.
